# Vencord CSS Tweaks

A collection of small but useful CSS tweaks.

## Installation

Copy the `tweaks.css` file inside of the `build/` directory into your Vencord themes directory.

## Building from source

It's literally a `less` file I'm sure you can figure it out if for some reason you want to build this.

## Todo

* Reorganize into multiple files.
* "Watch Stream" section of stream preview. 
* Only show status on hover.

## Version

~~`v1.0.0`~~ I give up on versioning this.
